#  The Kronos Incident

## Background
In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as
a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several
employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in
the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.


## Task 1: The Kidnapping and a Historical Analysis of the Protectors of Kronos

Your task is to bring law enforcement up to date on the current organization of the POK and how that organization has changed over time, as well as to characterize the events surrounding the disappearance. You are provided with a set of current and historical news reports at your disposal, as well as resumes of numerous GAStech employees and email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email. You are being
counted on to bring law enforcement up to date on the current organization of the POK and how that organization has changed over time, as well as to characterize the events surrounding the disappearance.

The data provided consists of a collection of text-based files dealing with the kidnapping of the GASTech employees by members of the social movement group POK.  As an analyst, you have the following data at your disposal:

* A map of Kronos
* A chart describing the local GAStech organization, in PDF format.
* A spreadsheet of GAStech employee records, in Microsoft Excel format. The primary worksheet contains the data; the index worksheet contains the data dictionary
* Email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email, in comma-separated values (CSV) format
* Resumes and short biographies of many, but not all, of the GAStech employees, in Microsoft Word format
* Historical reports and descriptions of the countries involved, in Microsoft Word format
* Relevant current and historical news reports from multiple domestic and translated foreign sources, in text file format. Because these articles have come from multiple sources and original formats, some of the them may contain corrupted characters, which is typical for this type of data. These corrupted characters should not interfere with your ability to analyze the data.
