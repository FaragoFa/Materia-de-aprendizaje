# Disaster at St. Himark!: Citizen Science to the Rescue
## Background
St. Himark is a vibrant community located in the Oceanus Sea. Home to the world-renowned St. Himark Museum, beautiful beaches, and the Wilson Forest Nature Preserve, St. Himark is one of the region’s best cities for raising a family and provides employment across a number of industries including the Always Safe Nuclear Power Plant. Well, all that was true before the disastrous earthquake that hits the area during the course of this year’s challenge. Mayor Jordan, city officials, and emergency services are overwhelmed and are desperate for assistance in understanding the true situation on the ground and how best to deploy the limited resources available to this relatively small community.

### Goals


## Deliverables

Please prepare __a single python notebook__ with the answers. However, feel free to use more than a single python file to solve tasks. If necessary, some results may be pre-computed and stored in separate files. Notebooks must clearly explain the answers to each question, supported by evidence derived from the data and visualized using the tools seen in the course. Describe the characteristics of the data you were given as well as your reasoning process leading to each answer. Use the following structure template for the answers notebook:

- project title, task name
- description and data characterization 
- answer question 1
- answer question 2
- ...
